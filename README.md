# Society Maintenance Application

A comprehensive mobile solution for managing society maintenance bills, collections, and reporting, built with **React Native** (frontend), **Express.js + Node.js** (backend), and **MongoDB** (database).

## Functional Overview

The app streamlines maintenance billing and cash collection for residential societies, supporting three user roles:

- **Admin** (superuser, default/hardcoded account)
- **Team Members** (cash collectors for houses)
- **Users / Residents** (house owners/tenants who pay maintenance bills)

- **Login & Signup:** Separate pages for all roles.
- **Admins:** One or two default Admin accounts, hardcoded in backend.

**User Registration Fields:**
